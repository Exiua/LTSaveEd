LTSaveEd is a save editor for the game _Lilith's Throne_ built using Java 14 and JavaFx 16.

## Requirements
Requires Java 14 or later if you are just running the .jar. Requires JavaFx 16 or later as well if you need to compile the program yourself.

## How To Use

Download and run `LTSaveEd.jar` from the [latest release](https://github.com/Exiua/LTSaveEd/releases). 

If the jar doesn't work, download and extract the zip from the [latest release](https://github.com/Exiua/LTSaveEd/releases) and add `--module-path /path/to/javafx-sdk-16/lib --add-modules=javafx.controls,javafx.fxml` as a VM option to your run configuration, then run `LTSaveEd.java`.

***Make a backup of your save first before using the save editor.***
